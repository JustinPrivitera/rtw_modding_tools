<!-- - tool that allows me to touch superfaction relationships
- tool that resets the map (julii have rome and all other regions are slave)
- tool that renames factions
	- by touching these files:
		- Data\DESCR_BANNERS.TXT
		- Data\DESCR_BUILDING_BATTLE.TXT
		- Data\DESCR_CHARACTER.TXT
		- Data\DESCR_LBC_DB.TXT

- tool that makes all factions playable
- tool that formats descr_strat parser so it ignores spaces in the diplomacy section, and perhaps does the tabs correctly
- tool that makes backups, maybe an undo command, a help command
- perhaps instead of hard coding each page, just make a page object that can display everything correctly
	- it could get terminal length and width and display that way, or it could just take up a fixed amount of space and write over itself to move to a new page
	- make a tree of pages
	- also there could be options to resize a page
		- this could be in "help"
- a tool that backs up everything that's been changed
- window where left side is where you write commands and interact and right side s where you can see the data you're working with
- more tools -->
